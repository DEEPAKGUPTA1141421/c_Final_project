Sorting Algorithms and Stack/Queue Implementation in C
This repository contains C implementations of various sorting algorithms as well as stack and queue data structures. Below, you'll find an overview of the contents and how to use them.

Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort is another straightforward sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element and moving it to the beginning of the array.
3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
4. Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a widely-used, efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
5. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sub-lists until each sub-list contains only one element. Then, it repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining.


Stack and Queue Implementations
1. Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This repository includes a stack implementation that allows you to perform typical stack operations, such as push, pop, and peek.
2. Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This repository includes a queue implementation that supports common queue operations, such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-and-data-structures-c.git
After cloning, you can explore and use the sorting algorithms and data structures in your C programs. Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in separate C files for easy integration into your projects.

Please refer to the individual source code files for detailed documentation and usage examples.
